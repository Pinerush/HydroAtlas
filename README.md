# HydroAtlas
I have designed a prototype of a Hydroclimate Atlas for Ohio. Hydroclimate Atlas is a digital atlas designed to give
information of various climate related information in Ohio. It will include tables, maps, graphs
and other various types of visualizations characterizing various measures like precipitation, soil
moisture and wind direction. The Hydroclimate Atlas for Ohio is not deployed yet. This project is
the first step to build a Hydroclimate Atlas for Ohio which will be rolled out in the future. But
there is Hydroclimate Atlas available for Switzerland
