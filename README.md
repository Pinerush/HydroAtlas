# HydroAtlas
I have designed a prototype of a Hydroclimate Atlas for Ohio. Hydroclimate Atlas is a digital atlas designed to give
information of various climate related information in Ohio. It will include tables, maps, graphs
and other various types of visualizations characterizing various measures like precipitation, soil
moisture and wind direction. The Hydroclimate Atlas for Ohio is not deployed yet. This project is
the first step to build a Hydroclimate Atlas for Ohio which will be rolled out in the future. But
there is Hydroclimate Atlas available for Switzerland

OARDC website is short form for Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center website.
All the data used in this project is sourced from this website.

The figure below shows various stations in Ohio. All these stations have sensors that measure
attributes like precipitation, wind direction and soil moisture and all the data recorded will be
presented to the end users via Hydroclimate Atlas.

There are various end users for this Hydroclimate Atlas. For example, farmers of Ohio need soil
moisture, weather forecast, climatology of specific crops and seasonal climate outlook
information to plan when to plant their crop for optimal results. Water Managers of Ohio need
statistical and dynamic safe flood and drought statistics, flood hydrographs and future flood
forecast to predict flood situations in the nearby future and try to implement any necessary
water resource management plans. The atlas will help end users explore all the information in
one place.
